## Monday's Homework Feedback
* Well done on this one! You were very close before homework review to getting this completely working!

* In show.html, you have a typo on line 5.

* Generally, I'd say be really careful of typos. Also, it's good to get used to reading error messages. You'll get more used to all this as you practice this more.

* Don't forget to include an *assets* folder in *src*, even if it's empty. Your client can't run without it.

* Well done getting this to work.

* Make sure you add in an assets folder in src and add a .gitkeep file in it.

* Also make sure you stick with the same naming convention for your views. So either call them all index.html | show.html | edit.html | new.html or call them all moustasheIndex.html | moustasheShow.html | moustasheEdit.html | moustasheNew.html.

* Apart from that this is all good so well done.

* Well done on this but please fix the issues in yesterdays feedback.

## Thursday Feedback
* Well done on this one.

* You still need to add a *.gitkeep* file into your *assets* folder, otherwise the client cannot start. Let me know if you'd like help with this bit, so we can get it fixed.

## WEEK 8

## Monday Feedback
* Well done on giving this a good go

* Your moustache index isn't working because you called your file `Index.html` and you're trying to link to `index.html` in your router.

* Your back end is working. Try adding `createdBy` fields to the `moustacheData`, so your moustaches can be linked to users.

* Before moving forward, I'd suggest you fix the above point, and do the register route on the front end.

## Tuesday Feedback
* Well done on this one

* Again, if you're going to do any more work on this, add your register route on the front end. It's very similar to the login route, and it means we can actually test your app.
